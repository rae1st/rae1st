# hello world

My name is **Raeist**. I currently work as a **beginner-backend engineer**.

I mostly work with **Python**, but I enjoy exploring other programming languages too. I love creating **libraries and reusable tools**, experimenting with different ideas, and learning new ways to solve problems.  

A lot of my development experience comes from writing **clean and practical scripts**, small projects, and testing concepts for fun. I enjoy building things from scratch and gradually improving them over time.  

Besides coding, I like learning **different programming paradigms**, contributing to open source when possible, and continuously improving my skills as a backend engineer.
