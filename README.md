# hello world

My name is **Raeist** and I go by waris. I currently work as beginner-backend engineer.

A lot of my history in development has been in writing Python scripts and creating small libraries. You can see a few of them below.

Nowadays, I mostly work on small backend projects and experimenting with different programming languages, making small changes to projects I personally use.
